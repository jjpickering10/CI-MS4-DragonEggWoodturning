## Overview

Prior to starting the Code Institute Software Development course, I had a little experience with basic understanding of web development. I used this basic knowledge to make a website with Shopify for my father to sell his woodturning products. Fast forward to now and my learning has come full circle as I now can create the store entirely on my own thanks to Code Institute.
